# Attrition analysis 


 By Neddy Nyatome and Blake Freeman


### Purpose, Summary and scope 


DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business greenlights the project, they have tasked our data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

A dataset was privided with the request to do an analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition.  Our team has focused on identifying 3 top three factors that contribute to turnover.

Additionally, we have identified some interest job role trends specific to to the roles as the business was also interested in learning about any job role trends that may exist in the data set


## Data Sets 


CaseStudy2-data


## Introduction/Getting Started
The main focus of this analysis was understanding all the data elements and identifying the various patterns within them while focusing on the factors that lead to attrition. 

A model was created for predicting the likelihood of an employee leaving using the KNN model 

Monthly income was also analyzed and regression model was used to predict employees income
